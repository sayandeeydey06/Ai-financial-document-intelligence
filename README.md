📄 AI Financial Document Intelligence Platform :

An AI-powered web application that extracts structured financial data from invoices (PDFs and images), including totals, tax, invoice numbers, risk indicators, and document classification.



✨ Features :

• Upload invoice images or PDFs

• OCR-based text extraction

• AI-powered financial field detection

• Invoice number, date, total, tax, vendor extraction

• Confidence scoring 

• Risk flag detection

• Document classification (Invoice / Receipt / Unknown)

• Editable extracted data

• JSON & CSV export

• Cloud deployment (Vercel + Render)




🧠 How It Works :

1. User uploads a document

2. OCR converts the document into raw text

3. Rule-based AI extracts financial fields

4. Confidence score and risk flags are calculated

5. Results are displayed and can be edited or exported
   



⚠️ Production OCR Limitation :

This project uses Tesseract OCR locally for high-accuracy image text extraction.

In cloud deployments (Vercel/Render), system-level OCR binaries are restricted.
To handle this, the system implements a graceful fallback mode:

        1.PDF documents with text → fully supported
        2.Image OCR → safely disabled in cloud
        3.The system returns structured placeholders instead of crashing

This design reflects real-world production constraints and demonstrates cloud-safe AI engineering.



🛠️ Tech Stack :

• Frontend: React (Vercel)

• Backend: FastAPI (Render)

• AI: OCR + Rule-based NLP

• Language: Python, JavaScript

• Export: CSV, JSON

• Deployment: Cloud-hosted REST architecture
