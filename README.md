📄 **AI Financial Document Intelligence Platform** :

🔍 **Overview** :

This project is a full-stack AI-powered system that processes invoice PDFs and images and converts them into structured financial data.It is designed to simulate how real finance teams automate invoice classification, validation, and data extraction.
The system combines OCR, rule-based NLP, and REST APIs to convert unstructured documents into usable JSON data.


🎯 **Problem It Solves**:

Finance teams receive thousands of invoices as PDFs and scanned images.
Manually reading and entering this data is slow, costly, and error-prone.

This platform:

1. Accepts invoice documents

2. Attempts automated OCR extraction

3. Structures the data into JSON

4. Detects missing or low-confidence fields

5. Flags risky or incomplete documents
   

🧠 **System Architecture**:

React Frontend

     ↓
FastAPI Backend

     ↓
Document Processing Engine

     ↓
OCR (Local Mode) OR Rule-Based Intelligence (Cloud Mode)

     ↓
Structured JSON + Confidence Score



🚀 **Key Features**:

• Upload invoice PDFs and images

• Automatic document type detection

• OCR-based text extraction (local environment)

• Rule-based extraction and validation (cloud)

• Confidence scoring for extracted data

• Structured JSON output

• Editable fields in the UI

• Cloud-hosted full-stack application




🌐 **Cloud Demo Behavior**:

The public demo is deployed on Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend).
These platforms do not support native OCR engines like Tesseract, so the system automatically switches to rule-based document intelligence mode when running in the cloud.

Instead of failing, the system:

1. Detects document type

2. Extracts available metadata

3. Calculates a confidence score

4. Returns structured JSON

5. Flags missing or unreliable fields
   


📊 **Real Cloud Output Example**:

Below is a real output generated by the deployed system:

{

  "invoice_number": null,
  
  "vendor_name": "historical data.",
  
  "invoice_date": ".",
  
  "total_amount": null,
  
  "tax_amount": null,
  
  "currency": "USD",
  
  "extraction_method": "rule-based",
  
  "confidence": 0.25,
  
  "summary": "Invoice N/A from historical data. dated ., Total amount is USD N/A with tax N/A.",
  
  "risk_flags": [],
  
  "document_type": "Invoice"
  
}



🖥 **Local Mode (Full OCR)** :

When run locally on Windows with Tesseract OCR installed, the system performs:

1. Full text extraction from invoices

2. Field detection (invoice number, date, tax, total)

3. High-accuracy JSON output

This is the same pipeline used in enterprise invoice automation




🔌 **API Endpoints**:

POST /upload         → Upload invoice file

GET  /analyze        → Process document

GET  /download-json  → Export extracted data
